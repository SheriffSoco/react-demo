# My first React project

Following tutorial from a [Next.js Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/)

This is a standard React webapp. No Next.js code is in this project. I am using the React review section to refresh my memory of React before diving into Next.js.

This project contains a simple title with a single to-do component that can be deleted. No to-do's can be added and the state does not persist when the webpage is refreshed.
